Generic types and functions that are missing from Go, including sets, trees,
linked lists, etc.

All code is implemented with 0 dependencies and in pure Go code (no CGo).

## Background

Go v1.18 is about to be released now in February 2022, and with it comes some
features that has been talked about for a really long time. One of which being
**generics!** [(Go 1.18 beta release notes)](https://tip.golang.org/doc/go1.18)

They have moved generics from the Go v2.0 milestone over to Go v1.18, which
means they have to stay backwards compatible and cannot alter any existing
types. On top of this, they do not seem to plan on releasing any generic data
types in the Go standard library until Go v1.19. All in all, to use generic
data types with Go v1.18, you'll have to either write your own, or use a
third-party package, like this one :)

This repository includes those generic functions and types that I find are
missing from the release of Go v1.18-beta1, as well as a number of other
data structures and utility functions I think should've been included in the
standard library a long time ago. But now with generics, we can finally have
sensible implementations of sets, trees, stacks, etc without excessive casting.

## Compatibility

Requires Go v1.18beta1 or later as the code makes use of generics.

## Installation and usage

```sh
go get -u gopkg.in/typ.v0
```

## Features
### Types

- `typ.AtomicValue[T]`: Atomic value store, wrapper around [`sync/atomic.Value`](https://pkg.go.dev/sync/atomic#Value).
- `typ.List[T]`: Linked list, forked from [`container/list`](https://pkg.go.dev/container/list).
- `typ.Pool[T]`: Object pool, wrapper around [`sync.Pool`](https://pkg.go.dev/sync#Pool).
- `typ.Publisher[T]`: Publish-subscribe pattern (pubsub) using channels.
- `typ.Ring[T]`: Circular list, forked from [`container/ring`](https://pkg.go.dev/container/ring).
- `typ.Set[T]`: Set, based on set theory.
- `typ.Stack[T]`: First-in-last-out collection.
- `typ.SyncMap[K,V]`: Concurrent map, forked from [`sync.Map`](https://pkg.go.dev/sync#Map).
- `typ.Tree[T]`: AVL-tree (auto-balancing binary search tree) implementation.

> Explanation:
>
> - Forked type: Copied their code and modified it so it uses generic types down
>   to the backing struct layer. This benefits the most from generics support.
>
> - Wrapped type: Code depends on the underlying non-generic type, and adds
>   abstraction to hide the type casting. Less performant than full generic
>   support, but is done to reduce excessive complexity in this repository.
>
> - Neither forked nor wrapped: Original code written by yours truly.

### Constraints

- `typ.Number`: Type constraint for any number: integers, floats, & complex.
- `typ.Real`: Type constraint for real numbers: integers & floats.

### Utility functions

<!-- lint disable maximum-line-length -->

- `typ.Clamp01[T](T) T`: Clamp a value between `0` and `1`.
- `typ.Clamp[T](T, T, T) T`: Clamp a value inside a range.
- `typ.Coal[T](...T) T`: Coalesce operator, returns first non-zero value.
- `typ.ContainsValue[K, V](map[K]V, V) bool`: Does map contain value?
- `typ.Contains[T]([]T, T) bool`: Does slice contain value?
- `typ.Max[T](...T) T`: Return the largest value.
- `typ.Min[T](...T) T`: Return the smallest value.
- `typ.Product[T](...T) T`: Multiplies together numbers.
- `typ.RecvTimeout[T](chan<- T, time.Duration)`: Receive from channel with timeout.
- `typ.Reverse[T]([]T)`: Reverse the order of a slice.
- `typ.Search[T]([]T, T)`: Searches for element index or insertion index in slice.
- `typ.SendTimeout[T](<-chan T, T, time.Duration)`: Send to channel with timeout.
- `typ.ShuffleRand[T]([]T, *rand.Rand)`: Randomizes the order of a slice.
- `typ.Shuffle[T]([]T)`: Randomizes the order of a slice.
- `typ.SortDesc[T]([]T)`: Sort ordered slices in descending order.
- `typ.Sort[T]([]T)`: Sort ordered slices in ascending order.
- `typ.Sum[T](...T) T`: Sums up numbers (addition).
- `typ.Tern[T](bool, T, T) T`: Ternary operator, return based on conditional.
- `typ.Zero[T]()`: Returns the zero value for a type.
